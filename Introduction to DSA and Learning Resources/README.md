# Introduction to DSA and Flowcharts

# Learned the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), its significance in problem-solving, and its real-world applications.

# Learned:
- DSA Definition: Core of computer science for organizing and processing data.
- Scope: DSA is applied in Web Development, Machine Learning, Database Management, and Competitive Programming.
- Flowcharts: Effective tools to plan and visualize algorithms before implementation.

## Key Concepts:
- Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs.
- Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming.
- Flowchart Basics: 
  - Start/End (Oval), 
  - Process (Rectangle), 
  - Decision (Diamond).

# Flowcharts helped me to visualize algorithm steps and their usage in planning solutions. However, the complexity of DSA seems intimidating at first, but I am excited to dive deeper.

# Resources Used:
1. Coursera Course: "Data Structures and Algorithms" (Using financial aid)
2. Websites:
   - GeeksforGeeks (for algorithm tutorials)
   - LeetCode (for coding practice)
   - HackerRank (for problem-solving practice
