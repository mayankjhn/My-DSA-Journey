# Introduction to DSA and Flowcharts

# Learned the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), its significance in problem-solving, and its real-world applications.

# Learned:
- DSA Definition: Core of computer science for organizing and processing data.
- DSA is applied in Web Development, Machine Learning, Database Management, and Competitive Programming.
- Flowcharts: Effective tools to plan and visualize algorithms before implementation.

# Key Concepts:
- Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs.
- Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming.
- Flowchart Basics 
  

#Flowcharts helped me to visualize algorithm steps and their usage in planning solutions. However, the complexity of DSA seems intimidating at first, but I am excited to dive deeper.

# Resources Used:
1. Websites:
   GeeksforGeeks (for algorithm tutorials)
   LeetCode (for coding practice)
   HackerRank (for problem-solving practice
